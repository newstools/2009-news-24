Sharlene Packree Durban socialite and businessman Roy Moodley made a brief appearance in a Pretoria court on bribery charges after he allegedly tried to bribe a government official for a better seat at president-elect Jacob Zuma’s inauguration tomorrow. National police spokesman Captain Dennis Adriao confirmed that Moodley appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court yesterday where he was charged with bribery and corruption. Adriao said that Moodley, a well-known horse breeder, was arrested shortly after he attempted to bribe a female official for a better seat at the inauguration celebrations. He spent several hours waiting in police cells before appearing in court yesterday morning. The case has been remanded to June 24 and Moodley was released on R2 000 bail. “We have very strict security plans in place for the celebrations. “We will not tolerate any incidents like these. “This is a warning to others that security agencies will clamp down on them,” Adriao said. Moodley, a close friend of Zuma, threw a huge party when the National Prosecuting Authority withdrew the fraud and corruption charges. The cream of Durban’s social scene attended the party, which was held at Moodley’s palatial home in La Lucia, north of Durban. Moodley, a registered breeder, has about 50 horses in training and also served as the director of Gold Circle in 2001. He also owns a security company and several accommodation businesses. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
